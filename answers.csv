Set_1: q1,Answer: C. Apoptosis,"Apoptosis is a complex type of programmed cell death. Apoptosis is an active gene regulated process, involving RNA and protein synthesis. It often only affects single cells or small cell groups. Morphologically, cells shrink in size and have dense eosinophilic cytoplasm. There is a condensation of nuclear chromatin followed by fragmentation. There is a cell breakdown into fragments (apoptotic bodies). The conservation of plasma membrane integrity is a key feature of this physiological death process. Apoptosis lack an inflammatory reaction by inducing certain cytokines and producing regulatory T cells. The Bcl-2 oncoprotein inhibits apoptosis and p53 stimulates apoptosis. Embryogenesis and menstrual cycle are physiological manifestations of apoptosis.
