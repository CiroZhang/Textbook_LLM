326.0,Set_12: q9,C. Primary biliary cholangitis,"Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is commonly seen in middle-aged females between the ages of 40 and 60 years. PBC is an autoimmune disease due to autoim - mune destruction of the intrahepatic bile ducts and cho - lestasis. Clinical manifestations include severe pruritus (may be severe at night), hepatosplenomegaly, and xan - thomatous lesions in the eyelids or in the skin. Laboratory findings show elevated alkaline phosphatase. 80–90% of the patients have AMA (anti-mitochondrial antibodies) in the serum. Cholangiopancreatography shows bile duct wall thickening, and dilatation of intra- and extra - hepatic bile ducts. Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is similar to primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with common clinical manifestations. Associated autoimmune dis - eases such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, Sjogren syn - drome, scleroderma, and Raynaud’s syndrome may be present. Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a premalig - nant condition."
327.0,Set_12: q10,A. Liver,"Liver is a common site of metastatic spread after lymph nodes. Most of the metastasis in liver originate from colon, pancreas, stomach, esophagus, breast, lung, gallbladder, uterus, kidney, melanoma, and urinary blad - der. Clinically, hepatomegaly is the most common find - ing besides signs and symptoms attributable to cancer in general and to the primary cancer. Jaundice occurs when the biliary system is invaded or obstructed. Ascites may form a non-specific late event. Unlike in HCC, the liver usually is not cirrhotic, and signs caused by portal hyper - tension are absent. For diagnosis, there is an increasing list of tumor markers, such as CEA, CA19–9, CA175, AFP. Perhaps CEA is the most frequently tested, and it is useful not only in disease diagnosis but also in the assessment of therapy and progression of disease."

Mallory bodies are damaged cytokeratin fila - ments and are seen as eosinophilic inclusions within the hepatocytes."
329.0,Set_12: q12,A. Cirrhosis of liver,"Cirrhosis is a chronic disease of the liver in which destruction with the regeneration of liver cells occurs. There is a diffuse increase in fibrous tissue that leads to disorganization of the lobular architecture. Clinically, this leads to portal hypertension and complications depending on the stage of disease. Patients with cirrhosis show triad of parenchymal necrosis, regeneration, and scarring. Infiltration of portal zones with leukocytes, mononuclear cells, or plasma cells may represent inflam - mation associated with initial injury, a response to con - tinued necrosis, or part of the reparative process. The morphological classification characterizes the gross appearance of the liver (micronodular, macronodular and mixed cirrhosis). Micronodular cirrhosis is charac - terized by the uniformity of the size of the nodules, vir - tually all of which are less than 3 mm in diameter. These micronodules lack a normal lobular organization and are surrounded by fibrous tissue. In micronodular cirrhosis, there is variation in nodular size, but most nodules are greater than 3 mm in diameter."
330.0,Set_12: q13,E. Hepatitis B (HBV) and Hepatitis C (HCV),"HCC (Hepatocellular carcinoma) is a malignant tumor of the liver. Numerous epidemiological and biological studies have suggested an important role of HBV infection in hepatocarcinogenesis.

This event usually takes 4–6 weeks following the episode of acute pancreatitis. Besides acute and chronic pancreatitis, other causes may include pancreatic trauma and iatrogenic (post partial gastrec - tomy). In acute pancreatitis, proteolytic enzymes cause disruption of pancreatic duct structure and leakage of pancreatic juice into peripancreatic space. There is a severe inflammatory reaction which leads to encapsula - tion of the cysts by fibrosed granulation tissue. Radiologically, they are seen as fluid filled oval or round collections with a thick wall. The pseudocyst is com - monly located in lesser sac, posterior to the stomach. They are not lined by epithelium. Pancreatic pseudo - cysts may regress on its own or interventions are required in selected cases."

There is an underlying carcinoma in 95% of the cases."
464.0,Set_17: q10,B. Axillary lymph node status,"Outcome of the invasive carcinoma of breast depends on axillary lymph node status. It is the most important prognostic factor. The second most important prognostic factor after lymph node status is the tumor size. Other prognostic factors include tumor grade, receptor status, lymphovascular invasion, expression of oncogenes, and loss of expression of tumor suppressor genes. The mar -gins and radiation predict local control, but they do not predict distant metastasis."
465.0,Set_17: q11,C. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS),"Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is detected by calci - fications with the advent of screening mammography. Light microscopy shows pleomorphic cells with central necrosis, central calcification, and stromal fibrosis. Comedo DCIS is more aggressive than noncomedo type DCIS. DCIS is a precursor to invasive ductal carcinoma. Low grade ductal carcinoma in situ is usually positive for estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors while high grade DCIS is usually not. Compared to high grade DCIS, low grade DCIS has a low proliferative index and fewer stromal vessels."
466.0,Set_17: q12,B. Breast cancer,"Human epidermal growth factor (HER2) gene muta - tion causes abnormal increase of HER2 on the breast cells. If the HER2 gene is mutated, this will cause an irregular increase in the amount of HER2 proteins on the cell surface. It promotes cell growth which may lead to cancer. About 20% of breast cancers are HER2-positive."
467.0,Set_17: q13,B. Fibroadenoma,"Fibroadenoma is the most common benign breast tumor (third most common breast lesion after fibrocystic changes and carcinoma). Peak incidence is between 20 and 35 years and occurs most often in women of child - bearing age. On gross examination, it is sharply encap - sulated and demarcated from the adjacent parenchyma. Cut surface is firm and white. Histologically, fibroade - nomas are composed of loose variably cellular fibrous stroma and glands or ducts lined by benign epithelium. When the granular pattern appears more prominent with open tubular spaces, it is termed a pericanalicular pat - tern. The intracanalicular growth pattern is more com - mon. In intracanalicular pattern, the glandular epithelium is compressed into cleft-like irregular structures. The two patterns do coexist but one pattern often dominates. The stroma is hypercellular and may show myxoid changes. Malignant transformation occurs in 0.1% of cases."

Clinically, patients present with weakness, weight loss, bronzing of the skin due to ACTH, dehydration, and hypotension. Other causes include tuberculosis (TB), fungal, viral, and amyloidosis. Autoimmune adrenalitis is usually associated with increased levels of 21-hydroxylase anti - bodies. It is a life threatening disorder that results from bilateral adrenal cortex destruction of adrenocortical hormones including cortisol, aldosterone. Over 90% of the gland is destroyed before symptomatic hypoadrenal - ism occurs. Histologically, the cortex is thin, and discon -tinuous with lipoid poor cells. There is patchy chronic inflammation centered on residual cortical tissue."

It produces cate - cholamines that can be detected in the urine as vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HV A). Gross appearance is solid or multinodular mass, deep red with small cysts and foci of necrosis and calci - fication. Microscopically, neuroblastoma is composed of small primitive neuroblasts separated by a pink fibrillar matrix. Groups of cells form Homer Wright rosettes around the fibrillar matrix. Prognosis is best in infants who present in the first 18 months of life. Many of these tumors seem to undergo a spontaneous remission or dis - appearance of the tumor without any treatment. Activation of the immune system is a key factor in the pathogenesis."
479.0,Set_18: q3,C. High dose dexamethasone suppression,The overnight high dose dexamethasone suppression test is an important test for the diagnosis of Cushing dis - ease. It helps to distinguish patients with Cushing dis - ease from most patients with the ectopic ACTH syndrome. High dose dexamethasone suppresses ACTH and cortisol secretion when Cushing’s syndrome is caused by a pituitary adenoma (Cushing disease) but not when it is caused by ectopic secretion (small cell lung cancer).
480.0,Set_18: q4,B. Cushing’s syndrome,"Common cause of Cushing’s syndrome is iatrogenic due to glucocorticoids and pituitary dependent Cushing’s syndrome. Paraneoplastic hypercortisolism due to small lung cancer can also cause Cushing’s syndrome. Common signs and symptoms of Cushing’s syndrome are obesity/weight gain, buffalo hump or dorsocervical fat pad, proximal muscle wasting and weakness, moon face, plethora, facial hirsutism, and increased supracla - vicular fat pads. Patients also present with lethargy, depression, hypertension, and abnormal glucose toler - ance. Menstrual irregularities are reported in women. Dermatological changes include easy bruisability, pur - ple striae on abdomen, skin atrophy, and hyperpigmenta - tion in areas exposed to light. Initial diagnostic test for hypercortisolism is sensitive. Hypercortisolism is con - firmed by finding elevated cortisol levels in a late night salivary sample or 24 h urine collection. ACTH secreted by small lung cancer is not inhibited by high dose exog - enous corticosteroids, but pituitary ACTH secretion decreases via negative feedback."
481.0,Set_18: q5,D. Pituitary adenoma,"Patient’s symptoms indicate the possibility of a pitu - itary tumor. Pituitary adenomas arise in the anterior lobe of the pituitary. Microadenomas are tumors less than 146 10 mm in diameter. Macroadenomas are tumors larger than 10 mm. Prolactinoma is the most common type of pituitary adenoma. Lactotrophs of the pituitary gland secrete the hormone prolactin. Large pituitary tumors can cause mass effects leading to headaches.

Etiology is an antithyroid antibody called thyrotro - pin receptor antibodies (TRA), thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TRA) or thyroid stimulating autoanti - bodies. They bind to TSH receptors on follicular cells, leading to overstimulation of the thyroid with thyroid enlargement, overproduction of thyroid hormones, sup - pression of TSH production, and hyperthyroidism. It accounts for 70–80% of hyperthyroidism and more com - mon in females. Most patients have both hyperthyroid - ism and goiter. Extrathyroidal manifestations include ophthalmopathy with proptosis caused by edema, lym - phocytic infiltration, and accumulation of glycosamino - glycans in extraocular muscles. Histologically, it shows diffusely abnormal gland with crowded follicles without colloid. Cytoplasm of follicular cells is eosinophilic and cuboidal to columnar. Nuclei are round, dense, small, and basally oriented. Intralobular fibrosis is present, accentuating lobular appearance of the tissue. Autoimmune basis is supported by TRA antibodies, higher incidence of genetic predisposition to Graves’ and other autoimmune diseases. There is also presence of HLA-Dr type II antigens on follicular cells."
484.0,Set_18: q8,C. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis,"Chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto’s) thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine suffi - cient regions such as developed countries. In contrast, worldwide hypothyroidism is due to an inadequate dietary intake of iodine. It is common in females with age range 45–65  years.

617.0,Set_23: q14,D. Central retinal artery occlusion,"In central retinal artery occlusion, there is acute mon - ocular vision loss. On fundus examination, fovea appears as a cherry red spot and the inner layer of the retina appears milky white."
618.0,Set_23: q15,B. Closed-angle glaucoma,"Increased pressure within the eyeball is called as glaucoma. Impaired aqueous humor drainage causes increased intraocular pressure in closed-angle glaucoma. Symptoms are acute headache, eye pain, and vision loss. Fundus examination shows cupping of the optic disc."
619.0,Set_23: q16,E. Retinitis pigmentosa,"Night blindness (nyctalopia) is one of the earliest symptoms of retinitis pigmentosa. The classic triad of attenuated arterioles, waxy pallor of the optic disc, and intraretinal pigmentation as bone-spicules is seen on fundus examination."
620.0,Set_23: q17,D. Tay-Sachs disease,Excess storage of Gm2 gangliosides due to deficiency in beta-Hexosaminidase A is found in Tay-Sachs dis - ease. It is an autosomal recessive disorder. Macular cherry red spots are seen on fundoscopic examination in Tay-Sachs disease.
621.0,Set_23: q18,E. Sickle cell anemia,"Superficial intraretinal hemorrhages (salmon-patch hemorrhage) are ocular manifestations of sickle cell dis - ease. Ocular manifestations are due to vascular occlu - sion, which may occur in the conjunctiva, iris, retina, and choroid."
622.0,Set_23: q19,A. Keratoconus,Keratoconus is a disorder of the cornea. It leads to thinning and cone-shaped protrusion of the cornea which causes blurred vision and sensitivity to light and glare. Keratoconus usually affects both eyes and generally affect people aged between 10 and 25 years old.
623.0,Set_23: q20,B. Xanthelasma,"Most eyelid lesions are benign such as hordeolum (stye), chalazion and xanthelasma. Xanthelasma appear as yellow plaques on the medial aspects of the eyelids in adults with hypercholesterolemia."
624.0,Set_23: q21,B. Cavernous hemangioma,"Patients of cavernous hemangioma present with pain - less proptosis of the eye with diplopia. Histologically, cavernous hemangioma lesions appear with large cysti - cally dilated vascular channels with fibrous septae. Imaging studies help in the diagnosis."
625.0,Set_23: q22,C. Molluscum contagiosum,"Molluscum contagiosum presents with a raised domes polypoid lesion with an umbilicated center. This lesion is a classical form molluscum contagiosum. Histologically, volcanic micro-craters are seen separated by normal areas of skin. Micro-craters are eosinophilic inclusion bodies pathognomonic for molluscum conta - giosum, referred to as Henderson–Patterson bodies."
626.0,Set_23: q23,A. Sarcoidosis,"Sarcoidosis occurs in the eye in approximately 15–50% of the patients who present with systemic dis - ease. Common ocular presentation is uveitis. Inflammatory nodules on the conjunctiva and pupillary margin are commonly seen in sarcoidosis. Histologically, sarcoidosis shows non-caseating, non-necrotizing gran - ulomas with Langerhans giant cells, epithelioid cells along with lymphocytic aggregates."
