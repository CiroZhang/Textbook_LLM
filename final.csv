Programmed cell death is also called as:,A. Degeneration,B. Calcification,C. Apoptosis,D. Necrosis,E. Atrophy,0.0,C. Apoptosis,"Apoptosis is a complex type of programmed cell death.

Interstitial keratitis,E. Pellucid marginal degeneration,622.0,A. Keratoconus,Keratoconus is a disorder of the cornea. It leads to thinning and cone-shaped protrusion of the cornea which causes blurred vision and sensitivity to light and glare. Keratoconus usually affects both eyes and generally affect people aged between 10 and 25 years old.
 Which of the following eye conditions have plaques and nodule composed of lipid laden histiocytes in the skin especially the eyelids?,A. Diabetes mellitus,B. Xanthelasma,C. Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma,D. Tuberous xanthomas,E. Orbital lipogranulomas,623.0,B. Xanthelasma,"Most eyelid lesions are benign such as hordeolum (stye), chalazion and xanthelasma. Xanthelasma appear as yellow plaques on the medial aspects of the eyelids in adults with hypercholesterolemia."
 A 61-year-old female presents with painless proptosis of the left eye and diplopia. Imaging studies show a well- defined soft tissue mass within the left eye. Excision of the soft tissue mass is done. Microscopic picture shows large cystically dilated vascular channels with fibrous septae. What is the diagnosis?,A. Fibrous histiocytoma,B. Cavernous hemangioma,C. Hemangiopericytoma,D. Solitary fibrous tumor,E. Intraocular melanoma,624.0,B. Cavernous hemangioma,"Patients of cavernous hemangioma present with pain - less proptosis of the eye with diplopia. Histologically, cavernous hemangioma lesions appear with large cysti - cally dilated vascular channels with fibrous septae. Imaging studies help in the diagnosis."

Molluscum contagiosum,D. Melanoma,E. Pyogenic granuloma,625.0,C. Molluscum contagiosum,"Molluscum contagiosum presents with a raised domes polypoid lesion with an umbilicated center. This lesion is a classical form molluscum contagiosum. Histologically, volcanic micro-craters are seen separated by normal areas of skin. Micro-craters are eosinophilic inclusion bodies pathognomonic for molluscum conta - giosum, referred to as Henderson–Patterson bodies."
 A 51-year-old male presents with bilateral blood vision and floaters. There is also bilateral intermediate uveitis. Which of the following entities would be consistent with this diagnosis?,A.
