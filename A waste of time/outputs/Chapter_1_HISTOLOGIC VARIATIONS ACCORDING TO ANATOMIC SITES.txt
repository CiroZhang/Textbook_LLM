Once the biopsy is done, the specimen should be placed in formalin fixative immediately for the purpose of routine histologic examination. Specimens needed for direct immu-nofluorescent study ideally should be placed in Michel's medium or, alternatively, put in saline-moistened gauze if it is going to be processed within 24 hours. Specimens required for flow cytometry, molecular studies, and electron microscopy are sent fresh in saline-soaked gauze or in the appropriate transport media; they should be processed as soon as possible. If the specimens are excisional biopsies or larger surgical material, proper sharing of the specimen is done, always with consideration that histology has priority if no prior diagnosis exists for that particular patient. Punch and shave biopsies are described grossly and either embedded intact or sectioned, depending on the size of the biopsy. Then the specimen is embedded on "edge". Five levels are usually obtained for histologic examination. Excisional biopsies and surgical specimens obtained for neoplasm are described grossly, and the entire deep and lat-eral margins of the specimen are inked before sectioning. The margins are evaluated by cutting along all margins or, most commonly, by entirely "bread loafing" the specimen. The entire neoplasm is also evaluated using the bread-loafing technique.
