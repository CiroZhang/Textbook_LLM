Lacour et al in a double indirect immunofluores-cence and immunoelectron microscopy with the monoclo-nal antibody Troma-1, have only found MCs in the proximal nail fold of the adults, with a concentration greater than SOMCs/mm 2. Immunohistochemically, keratins KS and K1S have been used as markers of MCs. MCs have neuroendo-crine characteristics and are of uncertain function, although their prominence in the nail unit in the early stages of fetal development has been noted, and a role in ontogenesis has been proposed. The number and location of cells demon-strating KS and K1S, which included the rete ridges of the digit pulp, suggested that these cells were MCs rather than contributing directly to nail plate formation.
