The skin accounts for about 15% of the total body weight and is the largest organ of the body. It is composed of three layers: epidermis, dermis, and the subcutaneous adipose tissue. Each component has its unique and com-plex structure and function, with variation accord-ing to age, gender, race, and anatomic location. Functions of the skin are extremely diverse. It serves as a mechanical barrier against external physical, chemical, and biologic noxious substances and as an immunologic organ. It par-ticipates in body temperature and electrolyte regulation. It is an important organ of sensuality and psychological well-being. In addition, it is a vehicle that expresses not only primary diseases of the skin, but also diseases of the internal organs. An understanding of the skin's normal histology is essential to the understanding of pathologic conditions.HISTOLOGIC VARIATIONS ACCORDING TO ANATOMIC SITES 19 PATHOLOGIC CHANGES FOUND IN BIOPSIES AND INTERPRETED AS "NORMAL SKIN" 20 SPECIMEN HANDLING 21 ARTIFACTS 21 STAINING METHODS 22 Histochemical Stains 23 Immunofluorescence 23 Immunohistochemical Stains/Molecular Studies 23 REFERENCES 26
