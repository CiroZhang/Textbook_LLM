The majority of the skin lesions can be diagnosed with well-prepared H&E-stained sections. However, they will not provide an adequate answer in all cases. A comprehensive review of "special stains" is beyond the scope of this chapter because every case is different and may require a specific approach. The following are the most common stains used in our laboratory in the study of cutaneous tissue. 1.49 Tissue defects in a basal cell carcinoma, which appear in the spaces after multiple sections were performed. PAS: To study the thickness of the basement mem-brane, for glycogen and fungal organ-isms 2. Comori's methenamine silver: For fungal organisms and cutaneous Pneumocystis cariniil. 3.Ziehl-Neels en and Fite stains: For acid-fast organisms 4.Gram's stains: For bacteria 5.Steiner and Warthin-Starry stains: In cases of bacil-lary angiomatosis and for spirochetes, although the later immunohistochemical method is preferred 6.Giemsa: For mast cells and protozoan organisms, such asLeishmania 7. Mucicarmine: For mucin 8. Alcian blue: For acid mucopolysaccharides and sulfated mucopolysaccharides 9. Congo red: For amyloid 10. Elastic van Gieson: For elastic fibers 11. Fontana-Masson: For melanin 12. Von Kossa: For calcium Immunofluorescence plays an important role in the diag-nosis and evaluation of skin disorders such as lupus ery-thematosus, vasculitis, and autoimmune blistering diseases. Specimens are provided to the laboratory either immedi-ately following biopsy on saline-soaked gauze or preferable in Michel's transport medium. Michel's transport medium is not a fixative, but a solution which stabilizes proteins for immunofluorescence. It is made up of citric acid, ammo-nium sulfate, n-ethylmaleimide, and magnesium sulfate and maintains at room temperature the isotonicity and pH of the tissue. Specimens that have been fixed in formalin generally are not able to be processed for immu-nofluorescent studies. Specimens that have been placed in Michel's transport medium and then processed for rou-tine H&E staining show a recognizable artifact in which there is a loss of nuclear detail. Immunofluorescent studies are either direct, using the patient's tissue, or indirect, using the serum of patients and a control tissue containing the relevant target molecules. Direct immunofluorescent studies are performed on cryostat sections of skin using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antisera to immunoglobulins A, G, and M, as well as fibrinogen and complement. Normal nonspecific stain-ing includes autofluorescence of dermal components such as elastic fibers, internal elastic laminae surrounding small-to medium-sized arteries and necrotic keratinocytes (colloid bodies). Basement membrane material can show weak auto-fluorescence that must be distinguished from true basement. "4 I....".. .........-, " 1.50 CAM5.2 immunostaining. The secretory glands but not the ducts are stained. membrane deposition. In addition, nonspecific staining can be seen in serum crust, spongiotic epidermis and linear zones surrounding blood vessels that have increased vascu-lar permeability. These nonspecific staining patterns tend to involve all FITC labeled immunoglobulins rather than spe-cific disease associated ones. Immunohistochemistry is the process of detecting cellular and fibrillar antigens in tissue section. The antigens may be cytoplasmic or nuclear and show cellu-lar events such as apoptosis or altered proliferation. Most commercially available antibodies can be used on formalin-fixed tissue. Positive or negative reactivity of the antibodies tested often depends on variables such as quality and dura-tion of fixation as well as the use of additional steps such as protease digestion and antigen retrieval. Additionally, rather than the usual "brown stain" DAB detection kit, we use a permanent "red" alkaline phosphatase detection kit, (Figure l.50) which is especially helpful in the diagnosis of pig-mented melanocytic lesions. Although a separate positive control slide is standard for each immunohistochemistry stain, this does not guarantee that the stain has worked properly for the patient's tissue. Interpretation of immunohistochemical studies relies on knowledge of normal skin components that can serve as internal positive controls. Immunohistochemistry is now widely used as an aid in the diagnosis of difficult cases where there is a defined differential. Examples include: Pigmented actinic keratosis and melanoma in situ, reactive and neo-plastic T-cell infiltrates, benign cutaneous lymphoid hyper-plasia and B-cell lymphoid neoplasms, atypical melanocytic proliferations and melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, intraepider-mal pagetoid proliferations, poorly differentiated epithelioid and spindle cell tumors. Some commonly used panels in our laboratory are shown in Tables l.2, l.3.

There are numerous cytokeratins available ranging from cocktails of high- or low-molecular weight cytokeratins to individual cytokeratins. High-molecular weight cytokeratins 34Be12 and 5/6 are reactive with epidermal and follicular keratinocytes along with eccrine and apocrine sweat glands. As cytokeratin 5/6 is found primarily in mesothelium and other lining type epithelia such as epidermis and squamous mucosa, it is a particularly useful antibody in differentiating metastases from primary cutaneous tumors, either epidermalor adnexal. We have also found these cytokeratins to be helpful in the diagnosis/detection of poorly differentiated squamous cell and infiltrating/morpheaform basal cell carci-nomas in fibrotic and inflamed dermis. Cytokeratin 20 is a heavy weight cytokeratin which shows a specific perinuclear dot-like staining pattern in cutaneous neuroendo-crine carcinomas. Cytokeratin 7 shows simi-lar dot-like perinuclear reactivity with extracutaneous (met-astatic) neuroendocrine carcinomas. Low-molecular weight 1.51 Normal melanocytes with brown melanin pigment. This coloration is identical to that of the diaminobenzidine chromogen often used with immunohistochemistry, making distinction of a positive immunostain versus background melanin difficult. cytokeratins such as CAM5.2 and cytokeratin 7 are reac-tive with secretory glandular cells found in sebaceous apo-crine and eccrine glands and are valuable in the diagnosis of Paget's disease along with adnexal carcinomas. Other antibodies useful in the diagnosis of epithelial tumors include BerEp4 and p63. BerEp4 is an epithelial antibody used in differentiating basal cell from squamous cell carcinomas, as well as microcystic adnexal carcinoma from basal cell carcinomas. p63 is a proliferation antibody, which shows nuclear staining of many cutaneous infiltrative malignancies. It is particularly helpful in the diagnosis of spindle cell/sarcomatoid squamous cell carci-nomas. Melanocytic antibodies include the highly sensitive S-100 protein along with antibodies specific to melano-cytes such as Melan-NMART-l, HMB-45, and tyrosinase.34Be12 EMA BerEp4 Basal cell carcinoma + Squamous cell carcinoma + + + Melan-NMART-l and tyrosinase are antibodies associated with pre-melanosomes and are present in both benign and malignant neoplasms. However, HMB-45 reactivity is lim-ited to activated melanocytes and melanocytes with abun-dant melanin. This fact is utilized in differentiating atypical non-neoplastic dermal nevo-rnelanocytic proliferations from melanoma. Non-neoplastic nevo-rnelanocytic proliferations show a loss of HMB-45 reactivity upon progressive descent into the dermis, whereas most melanomas show no loss of HMB-45 reactivity. Another antibody useful in the diagno-sis of malignant melanocytic lesions is the nuclear prolif-eration antibody Ki-67. Similar to HMB-45, benign nevo-melanocytic lesions show a low to absent Ki-67 positiv-ity while many melanocytic malignancies show an increased Ki-67 staining pattern. However, not all melanomas show increased Ki-67 positivity and some may be negative. Melanocytic antibodies are helpful in the diagnosis of atypical dermal spindle cell malignancies and atypical epi-dermal proliferations. In desmoplastic/spindle cell melano-mas, there is variable reactivity with MART-l/Melan-A and HMB-45 is almost always negative. S-100 is often the only melanocytic antibody which is positive. MART-liMelan-A is useful in differentiating pigmented atypical keratinocytic epidermal proliferation from atypical junctional melanocytic proliferations (melanoma in situilentigo maligna). Antibodies which are reactive with varied normal mes-enchymal elements within the dermis and subcutis are use-ful when identifying their neoplastic counterparts.
