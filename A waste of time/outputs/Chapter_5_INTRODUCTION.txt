Bone, cartilage, ligaments, and tendons have a mechanical function: Providing movement, stability, and protection. Unlike the liver or kidneys, which are composed mainly of cellular elements with a metabolic function, the connec-tive tissues are mostly formed of an extracellular material made up of substances to resist the tensile and compressive forces to which they are subjected. The cel-lular component of the connective tissues provides for their growth and maintenance.
