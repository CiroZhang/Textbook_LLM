Historical interest can be traced to the works of Galen in the second century Bewhen he noticed the nail's resemblance to hair structure. However, the real study of the nail begins at the end of the nineteenth century, mostly by Germans like Zander 0), Kolliker, and Unna. The first stud-ies dealt with embryology and anatomy and their compari-son to birds and primates. After the initial spark of interest, the nail literature was enriched by many authors, both on the embryology and the anatomy of the human nail. Due to the technical shortcomings of their time, the authors interpreted the nail plate as formed entirely by the matrix cells and concluded that other adjacent structures did not contribute in the formation of the plate. During the 1950s, Lewis challenged this view and published his idea of the "nail unit," consisting of a dorsal, intermediate, and ventral nail, with differentiation based on the use of a silver-proteinate stain. In 1963, Zaias extended the concept of the "nail unit," including the proxi-mal nail fold, the matrix, the nail bed, and the hypo-nychium, all of which contribute to the formation of the nail. During the last 25 years, most studies on the nail have fundamentally tried to explain its biochemistry and physiol-ogy, with emphasis on analyzing nail growth; also consid-ered were ultrastructure and, most recently, the immuno-histochemistry of the nail. Difficult biopsy access, as well as the complicated ori-entation and specimen handling, with the resulting diffi-culties of interpretation, are the main reasons why there are few histologic and histopathologic studies on the nail.
