The principal arterial supply to the breast is provided by the internal mammary and lateral thoracic arteries. Per-forating branches of the internal mammary artery pro-vide the blood supply to approximately 60% of the breast, mainly the medial and central portions. Approximately 30% of the breast, mainly the upper and outer portions, receives blood from the lateral thoracic artery. Branches of the thoracoacromial, intercostal, subscapular, and tho-racodorsal arteries make minor contributions to the mam-mary blood supply. Venous drainage of the breast, as in other locations, shows considerable individual variation but largely follows the arterial system. There is a superficial venous complex that runs transversely from lateral to medial in the subcuta-neous tissue. These vessels then drain into the internal tho-racic vein. Deep venous drainage of the breast is via three routes: the perforating branches of the internal thoracic vein, branches of the axillary vein, and tributaries of the intercostal veins, which drain posteriorly into the vertebral veins and the vertebral plexus.
