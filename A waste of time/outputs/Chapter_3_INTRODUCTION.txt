Remarkable advances in breast imaging over the past decade have provided a variety of noninvasive means to assist in the evaluation of patients with breast disorders. N ever-theless, at the present time, histologic examination of tis-sue specimens remains the cornerstone for the diagnosis of breast diseases, and an understanding of normal breast his-tology is essential for accurate evaluation of such specimens. It should be noted, however, that what constitutes "normal" histology in the breast varies according to sex, age, meno-pausal status, phase of the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and lactation, among other factors. Therefore, determination of whether a given breast specimen is normal or shows patho-logic alterations must take these variables into consideration.
