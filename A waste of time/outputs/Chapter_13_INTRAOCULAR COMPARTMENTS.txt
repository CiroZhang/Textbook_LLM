The eyelids can be divided into cutaneous and conjunctival portions. The cutaneous segment of the eyelid is composed of a stratified squamous epidermis over-lying a loosely arranged dermis, beneath which is muscular tissue. The eyelids contain several types of skin append-ages. Sebaceous glands deposit their secretions, together with decomposed whole cells via ducts, into hair follicles of the eyelashes, or into ducts that open into the lid margins. Apo-crine glands, whose secretions represent the pinched-off luminal aspect of the lining acinar cells, also open into the follicles of the eyelashes. In addition, the dermis of the eyelid contains eccrine sweat glands, which discharge secretions directly onto the skin viaa convoluted duct. The subcutaneous portion of the upper and lower eyelids contains concentrically arranged skeletal muscle fibers, but very little adipose con-nective tissue. Striated muscle of the palpebral portion of the levator palpebrae superioris is also present in the upper eyelid; it terminates in a dense fibrocollagenous aponeuro-sis. Small bundles of smooth muscle fibers (Muller's mus-cle) are located within the upper and lower eyelids. The junction between the cutaneous and conjunctival parts of the eyelid is demarcated clinically by a sulcus (the gray line), located between the ducts of the meibomian glands and the eyelashes. The conjunctival portion of the eyelid is made up of dense connective tissue containing the meibomian glands and the palpebral con-junctiva. The tarsus, located immediately posterior to the muscles of the eyelid, accounts for most of the rigidity of the eyelids and is covered posteriorly by conjunctival epithelium and a thin subepithelial stroma. As described earlier, accessory lacrimal glands are present in the palpebral conjunctiva. The presence of more prominent subcutaneous, subor-bicularis, and pretarsal fat tissue in the upper eyelid (the pretarsal fat pad) distinguishes an Asian eyelid from a Cau-casian eyelid.
