The two most distinctive histologic features of fetal brain compared to adult brain are active neurogenesis and pau-city of myelin. The former is observed as a prominent, dense aggregation of neuroblasts and immature neurons in the periventricular and subpial zones. A similarly transient layer of migrating neurons in the fetal and infant cerebel-lum has been discussed. These generative laminae begin involuting during the latter part of gestation; remnants are present during the first year of postnatal life.
