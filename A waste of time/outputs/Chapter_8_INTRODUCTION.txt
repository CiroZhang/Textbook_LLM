All the individual muscles in the body taken as a whole comprise skeletal muscle, the largest organ in the body by weight and volume. Although all muscles share many com-mon attributes, many of the more than 400 muscles differ in size, shape, and function that encompass swallowing, respiration, posture, and ocular movement. Not only is the variation in the gross anatomy of these muscles consider-able, but the histologic characteristics such as fiber size and fiber type proportion varies with site. Since many anatomic pathologists are called upon to interpret microscopic find-ings in muscle as they relate to disease, a familiarity with the histology of normal muscle is the basis of any accurate assessment of this kind. Today, an understanding of muscle histology as a discipline of modern pathology is dependent upon some knowledge of developmental biology and molec-ular biology.
