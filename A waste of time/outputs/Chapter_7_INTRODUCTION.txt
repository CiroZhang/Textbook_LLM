Incompiling this chapter, our intention was to provide prac-ticing surgical pathologists with both a description of normal and abnormal adipose tissue and a reference source. We were inclusive in our approach and considered all bodily lesions containing mature fat appropriate for discussion regardless of site. The section on development should provide a deeperIschemia 191 Metaplasia 191 LIPODYSTROPHY 192 ADIPOCYTES IN ORGANS 192 Fatty Infiltration 192 FAT BIOPSY FOR AMYLOID 193 INFLAMMATIONS 194 Fat Necrosis 194 Calciphylaxis 194 Panniculitis 195 Mesenteritis 195 Lipogranuloma 195 TUMORS AND TUMOR-LIKE LESIONS 195 Brown Fat Lesions 195 White Fat Lesions 196 Special Lipoma Types 200 Lipoblastoma 200 CYTOGENETICS OF LIPOMAS 201 SYNDROMES ASSOCIATED WITH FATTY LESIONS 201 MIMICS OF FAT CELLS 202 Mature Fat Cells 202 Lipoblasts 202 REFERENCES 203 understanding for the diagnostician and a starting point for the researcher. Collected and detailed as a group are the fatty infiltrations of organs, the inflammations affecting fat, the hamartomas and mesenchymomas, and the lipomas and variants thereof. Up-to-date definitions are provided where necessary. Importantly, we have also summarized clinical and genetic syndromes in which fat cells may participate. Unusual but distinctive histologies are enumerated, such as may occur in starvation, pancreatic fat necrosis, and true lipodystrophy. All topics are well-referenced, hopefully pro-viding the reader with a valuable resource. In short, we have attempted to describe not only as many lesions as possible, not just primary fatty entities, but also anything extraneous within adipose tissue or confused with it.
