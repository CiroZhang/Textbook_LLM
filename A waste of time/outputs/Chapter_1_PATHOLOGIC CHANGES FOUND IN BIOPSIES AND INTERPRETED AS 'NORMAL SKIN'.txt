Poor histologic preparation as a result of artifacts will ham-per the evaluation of slides by the pathologists. These arti-facts can be the result of various factors. 1.Fixation problems such as poor or no fixation of the specimen before cutting, old solutions being used, ined by "bread loafing" the specimen; the deep margin is also evalu-ated. The lateral margins are included in each section submitted for histologic evaluation, or they can be submitted separately by cutting them along the depicted interrupted lines. insufficient fixation time, or inadequate volume of fixative (ideally, the specimen must be properly fixed in a solution 15 to 20 times the volume of the speci-men) 2. Improper monitoring of the multiple steps involved in the preparation of a slide, such as cutting, temperature of the water bath, freshness of the staining solutions employed, and other factors 3. Artifacts produced at the time of excision, such as cautery and excessive squeezing of the speClmen such a sample is difficult to evaluate. Freezing artifacts of a specimen with vacuolar changes in the epidermis. 4. Specimens stored at low temperatures, giving freezing artifacts 5. Artifacts characteristically seen in certain pathologic processes, such as tissue holes in basal cell carcinoma and the lack of epidermis in sections from toxic epidermolytic necrolysis
