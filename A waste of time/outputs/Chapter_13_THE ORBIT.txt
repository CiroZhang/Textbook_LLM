The lacrimal drainage apparatus, composed of the puncta, canaliculi, lacrimal sac, and the nasolacri-mal duct, collects the tears and drains them to the nose. Tear fluid drains toward the medial canthus and then passes through an opening in the medial aspect of each eyelid, stratified squamous epithelium and are surrounded by fibrous tissue IH&E x13.2). fied columnar and contains goblet cells. known as the lacrimal punctum. The puncta drain into the lacrimal canaliculi, tubular structures approximately 0.5 mm in diameter. Initially, the canaliculi are oriented ver-tically, but within 2 mm of their origin, bend at right angles to become almost horizontal within the eyelids. The distal portions of the canaliculi exit the upper and lower eyelids. They merge to form the lacrimal sac, which is encased by bones located in the inferomedial wall of the orbit. A duct that is nearly 1ern long drains the lacrimal sac into the inferior nasal meatus of the nose. The epithelium lining the lacrimal drainage apparatus varies in different regions. In the canaliculi, it is a nonkeratinizing stratified squamous epithelium, but in the lacrimal sac and duct, the epithelium is stratified colum-nar in type, and contains mucus-secreting goblet cells sur-rounded by connective tissue.
