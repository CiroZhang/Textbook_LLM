The central nervous system is unparalleled among natural systems in terms of structural and functional complexity. As a consequence of its intricate regional architecture, heterogeneous cellular constituents, and an associated extensive and somewhat arcane lexicon, the nervous system is often viewed as a formidably Byzantine realm by many non-neuropathologists; and yet, a working familiarity with the normal morphology of this complex organ must precede competent evaluation of the many disease states that afflict it. To this end, this chapter will present the salient features of regional neuroanatomy followed by a description of the essentials of micro-scopic anatomy of the eNS, with special emphasis on those aspects that constitute potential diagnostic pitfalls, including normal anatomic variations, alterations associ-ated with advancing age, reactive changes, and common artifacts.Olfactory Bulbs and Tracts 322 Choroid Plexus 322 Circumventricular Organs 325 INTRADURAL ELEMENTS OF THE PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM 327 MENINGES 330 Dura Mater [Pachvmanix] 330 Pia-arachnoid ILeptomeninges) 332 Leptomeningeal Melanocytes 335 Optic Nerve 335 FETAL BRAIN 336 ARTI FACTS 336 SUGGESTED READINGS 340
