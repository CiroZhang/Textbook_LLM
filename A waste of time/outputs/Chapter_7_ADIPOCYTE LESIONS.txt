It is becoming increasingly popular to perform a subcutaneous fat biopsy for the diagnosis of amyloidosis. In such instances, the Congo red stain may reveal amyloid around blood vessels and, occasionally, between adipocytes. This pro-cedure is at least as sensitive as the rectal biopsy, can identify up to 84% of cases, can be combined withother studies to determine amyloid type, and is a safe and innocuous way to make the diagnosis. Biopsy analysis of adipose tissue may become important in the future to assess a given individual's storage content of toxic chemicals. Various industrial and environmental hydrocarbons are stored predominantly in fat, and subcuta-neous adipose tissue deposits may be analyzed and results correlated with the development of diseases such as neo-plasia.
