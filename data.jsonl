Necrosis \n E. Atrophy\n You should generate the output in the following format: \"[A/B/C/D/E]. [Reasons].\"", "Correct Answer": "C. Apoptosis \n Reason: Apoptosis is a complex type of programmed cell death. Apoptosis is an active gene regulated process, involving RNA and protein synthesis. It often only affects single cells or small cell groups. Morphologically, cells shrink in size and have dense eosinophilic cytoplasm. There is a condensation of nuclear chromatin followed by fragmentation. There is a cell breakdown into fragments (apoptotic bodies). The conservation of plasma membrane integrity is a key feature of this physiological death process. Apoptosis lack an inflammatory reaction by inducing certain cytokines and producing regulatory T cells. The Bcl-2 oncoprotein inhibits apoptosis and p53 stimulates apoptosis. Embryogenesis and menstrual cycle are physiological manifestations of apoptosis. Sources of pathological apoptosis include viral hepa - titis (councilman bodies), graft versus host disease (GvHD), and cystic fibrosis."}

Infected individuals most commonly have non-invasive disease with mild diarrhea and abdominal cramping. Almost 10% of the patients, though, will have an invasive, dysenteric course of dis - ease. Identification of E. histolytica can be made on morphology. Amebae may invade the cryptids of colonic glands and burrow down into the submucosa creating  36 flask-shaped ulcers. They can penetrate the portal venous system and spread to the liver, causing liver abscesses. E. histolytica cysts usually measure 10\u201315 \u03bcm and have four nuclei with centrally-located karyosomes.

Metastatic tumors to the liver\n You should generate the output in the following format: \"[A/B/C/D/E]. [Reasons].\"", "Correct Answer": "A. Cirrhosis of liver \n Reason: Cirrhosis is a chronic disease of the liver in which destruction with the regeneration of liver cells occurs. There is a diffuse increase in fibrous tissue that leads to disorganization of the lobular architecture. Clinically, this leads to portal hypertension and complications depending on the stage of disease. Patients with cirrhosis show triad of parenchymal necrosis, regeneration, and scarring. Infiltration of portal zones with leukocytes, mononuclear cells, or plasma cells may represent inflam - mation associated with initial injury, a response to con - tinued necrosis, or part of the reparative process. The morphological classification characterizes the gross appearance of the liver (micronodular, macronodular and mixed cirrhosis). Micronodular cirrhosis is charac - terized by the uniformity of the size of the nodules, vir - tually all of which are less than 3 mm in diameter. These micronodules lack a normal lobular organization and are surrounded by fibrous tissue.

Gestational hyperthyroidism\n You should generate the output in the following format: \"[A/B/C/D/E]. [Reasons].\"", "Correct Answer": "B. Graves\u2019 disease \n Reason: Graves\u2019 autoimmune is an autoimmune hypothyroid - ism. Etiology is an antithyroid antibody called thyrotro - pin receptor antibodies (TRA), thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TRA) or thyroid stimulating autoanti - bodies. They bind to TSH receptors on follicular cells, leading to overstimulation of the thyroid with thyroid enlargement, overproduction of thyroid hormones, sup - pression of TSH production, and hyperthyroidism. It accounts for 70\u201380% of hyperthyroidism and more com - mon in females. Most patients have both hyperthyroid - ism and goiter. Extrathyroidal manifestations include ophthalmopathy with proptosis caused by edema, lym - phocytic infiltration, and accumulation of glycosamino - glycans in extraocular muscles. Histologically, it shows diffusely abnormal gland with crowded follicles without colloid. Cytoplasm of follicular cells is eosinophilic and cuboidal to columnar. Nuclei are round, dense, small, and basally oriented. Intralobular fibrosis is present, accentuating lobular appearance of the tissue.
